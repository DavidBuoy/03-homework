# Pass Word Generator 
## Homework 3
<br>

For this assingnment I used HTML and CSS that were given to me as a template, and I used the skills in my class to use JavaScript to create a randomly generated Password Generator.

Below are some of the criteria and requirements for the responsive site that I made. 

<br>

## What I did.
* I used Java Script to create a program that randomly selects a password for you. It prompts you to use select some of the critiria that you would like to be randomized in your password.

# Critiria for Assignment. 

* As a user they need a new, secure password
* Clicking the button will generate a password
* After clicking the user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* After the user selects which criteria to include in the password they are promted to choice between:
    * length of the password of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters character types to include in the password
    * lowercase
    * uppercase
    * numeric
    * special characters
* After input the user should have a  validated and at least one character type should be selected.

* Once all prompts are answered the password is generated   and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
